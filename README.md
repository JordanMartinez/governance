# Purpose

The core PureScript GitHub organization exists to maintain and develop:

*   The PureScript language (as defined by the implementation in the `purescript` compiler project).
*   The PureScript standard library (`purescript-*` projects).
*   The PureScript website infrastructure (purescript.org, Try PureScript, Pursuit)
*   Documentation
*   Package Sets

# Core Owners

Organization ownership is primarily predicated on having commit access to the
core compiler. Since the language is defined by its implementation, this
project and associated responsibilities are what largely shape its direction
and development.

The core organization owners are:

*   Harry Garrood (@hdgarrood)
*   Gary Burgess (@garyb)
*   Liam Goodacre (@LiamGoodacre)
*   Christoph Hegemann (@kritzcreek)
*   Hardy Jones (@joneshf)
*   Nathan Faubion (@natefaubion)

Owners have demonstrated a long-term commitment to maintaining the compiler,
maintaining the standard library, and engaging with the language community as
a whole.

# Core Collaborators

Core owners may extend commit access on a project basis to those that have
expressed interest in maintaining a subset of the organization. Collaborators
include:

*   Alex Berg (@chexxor) - Documentation, Infrastructure
*   Thomas Honeyman (@thomashoneyman) - Infrastructure
*   Justin Woo (@justinwoo) - Package Sets
*   Fabrizio Ferrai (@f-f) - Package Sets
